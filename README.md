# Synapse-archive

Programs used in the project to renovate the Synapse site (synapsemag.org), particularly the archive. Includes a JavaScript object defining article data (articles.js), a script to generate the archive page's html from the article data (archive.js), adding a filter-by-category function to the archive (filter.js), and adding a feature to the staff page to view articles associated with that staff member (staff.js).
