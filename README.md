# Synapse-archive

Program used in the project to add all of Synapse's old articles on Atavist to their WordPress site. 
After using a content script to scrape the image sources, headlines, subtitles, and bylines from the Atavist site, 
this program generates, formats, and styles the html to insert into the new Synapse archive.
